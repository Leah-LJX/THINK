Parameters: source - the source collection.
suffix - the suffix added to each source series name to create the
                corresponding moving average series name.
periodCount - the number of periods in the moving average

[Method Summary]
static TimeSeriesCollection createMovingAverage(TimeSeriesCollection source, String suffix, int periodCount, int skip)	Creates a new TimeSeriesCollection containing a moving average series for each series in the source collection.
static TimeSeries createMovingAverage(TimeSeries source, String name, int periodCount, int skip)	Creates a new TimeSeries containing moving average values for the given series.
static XYSeries createMovingAverage(XYDataset source, int series, String name, double period, double skip)	Creates a new XYSeries containing the moving averages of one series in the source dataset.
static XYDataset createMovingAverage(XYDataset source, String suffix, double period, double skip)	Creates a new XYDataset containing the moving averages of each series in the source dataset.
static XYDataset createMovingAverage(XYDataset source, String suffix, long period, long skip)	Creates a new XYDataset containing the moving averages of each series in the source dataset.
static TimeSeries createPointMovingAverage(TimeSeries source, String name, int pointCount)	Creates a new TimeSeries containing moving average values for the given series, calculated by number of points (irrespective of the 'age' of those points).
