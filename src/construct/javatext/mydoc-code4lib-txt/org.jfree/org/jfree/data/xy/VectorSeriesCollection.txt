Comparable getSeriesKey(int series)	Returns the key for a series.
Vector getVector(int series, int item)	Returns the vector for an item in a series.
double getVectorXValue(int series, int item)	Returns the x-component of the vector for an item in a series.
double getVectorYValue(int series, int item)	Returns the y-component of the vector for an item in a series.
Number getX(int series, int item)	Returns the x-value for an item within a series.
double getXValue(int series, int item)	Returns the x-value for an item within a series.
Number getY(int series, int item)	Returns the y-value for an item within a series.
double getYValue(int series, int item)	Returns the y-value for an item within a series.
int indexOf(VectorSeries series)	Returns the index of the specified series, or -1 if that series is not present in the dataset.
void removeAllSeries()	Removes all the series from the collection and sends a DatasetChangeEvent to all registered listeners.
boolean removeSeries(VectorSeries series)	Removes the specified series from the collection and sends a DatasetChangeEvent to all registered listeners.
