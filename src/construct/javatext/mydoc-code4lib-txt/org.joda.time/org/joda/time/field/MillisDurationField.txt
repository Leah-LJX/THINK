[Method Summary]
long add(long instant, int value) Adds a duration value (which may be negative) to the instant.
long add(long instant, long value) Adds a duration value (which may be negative) to the instant.
int compareTo(DurationField otherField) boolean equals(Object obj) int getDifference(long minuendInstant, long subtrahendInstant) Computes the difference between two instants, as measured in the units of this field.
long getDifferenceAsLong(long minuendInstant, long subtrahendInstant) Computes the difference between two instants, as measured in the units of this field.
