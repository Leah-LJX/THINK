[Method Summary]
int compareTo(ReadableInstant other) Compares this object with the specified object for ascending millisecond instant order.
boolean equals(Object readableInstant) Compares this object with the specified object for equality based on the millisecond instant, chronology and time zone.
int get(DateTimeField field) Get the value of one of the fields of a datetime.
int get(DateTimeFieldType type) Get the value of one of the fields of a datetime using the chronology of the instant.
DateTimeZone getZone() Gets the time zone of the instant from the chronology.
int hashCode() Gets a hash code for the instant as defined in ReadableInstant.
boolean isAfter(long instant) Is this instant strictly after the millisecond instant passed in comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isAfter(ReadableInstant instant) Is this instant strictly after the instant passed in comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isAfterNow() Is this instant strictly after the current instant comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isBefore(long instant) Is this instant strictly before the millisecond instant passed in comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isBefore(ReadableInstant instant) Is this instant strictly before the instant passed in comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isBeforeNow() Is this instant strictly before the current instant comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isEqual(long instant) Is this instant equal to the millisecond instant passed in comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isEqual(ReadableInstant instant) Is this instant equal to the instant passed in comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isEqualNow() Is this instant equal to the current instant comparing solely by millisecond.
boolean isSupported(DateTimeFieldType type) Checks if the field type specified is supported by this instant and chronology.
