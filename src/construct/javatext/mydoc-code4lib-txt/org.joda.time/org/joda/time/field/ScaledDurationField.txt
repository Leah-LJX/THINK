[Method Summary]
long add(long instant, int value) Adds a duration value (which may be negative) to the instant.
long add(long instant, long value) Adds a duration value (which may be negative) to the instant.
boolean equals(Object obj) Compares this duration field to another.
int getDifference(long minuendInstant, long subtrahendInstant) Computes the difference between two instants, as measured in the units of this field.
long getDifferenceAsLong(long minuendInstant, long subtrahendInstant) Computes the difference between two instants, as measured in the units of this field.
long getMillis(int value) Get the millisecond duration of this field from its value, which is approximate if this field is imprecise.
long getMillis(int value, long instant) Get the millisecond duration of this field from its value relative to an instant.
long getMillis(long value) Get the millisecond duration of this field from its value, which is approximate if this field is imprecise.
long getMillis(long value, long instant) Get the millisecond duration of this field from its value relative to an instant.
int getScalar() Returns the scalar applied, in the field's units.
long getUnitMillis() Returns the amount of milliseconds per unit value of this field.
int getValue(long duration) Get the value of this field from the milliseconds, which is approximate if this field is imprecise.
int getValue(long duration, long instant) Get the value of this field from the milliseconds relative to an instant.
long getValueAsLong(long duration) Get the value of this field from the milliseconds, which is approximate if this field is imprecise.
