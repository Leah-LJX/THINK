[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: AutoCloseable, SequenceStream<POSSample>, ObjectStream<Sequence<POSSample>>
public class POSSampleSequenceStream extends Object implements SequenceStream<POSSample> A SequenceStream implementation encapsulating samples.
[Constructor Summary]
POSSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<POSSample> psi)	Creates a POSSampleSequenceStream with given samples using a DefaultPOSContextGenerator.
POSSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<POSSample> psi, POSContextGenerator pcg)	Creates a POSSampleSequenceStream with given samples using a POSContextGenerator.
[Method Summary]
void close()	Closes the ObjectStream and releases all allocated resources.
Sequence<POSSample> read()	Returns the next ObjectStream object.
void reset()	Repositions the stream at the beginning and the previously seen object sequence will be repeated exactly.
Event[] updateContext(Sequence<POSSample> pss, AbstractModel model)	Creates a new event array based on the outcomes predicted by the specified parameters for the specified Sequence.
