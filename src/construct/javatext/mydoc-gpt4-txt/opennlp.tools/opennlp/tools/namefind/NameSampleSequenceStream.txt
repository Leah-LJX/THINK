[API Name] opennlp.tools.namefind.NameSampleSequenceStream
[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: AutoCloseable, SequenceStream<NameSample>, ObjectStream<Sequence<NameSample>>
public class NameSampleSequenceStream extends Object implements SequenceStream<NameSample> A SequenceStream implementation encapsulating samples.
[Constructor Summary]
NameSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<NameSample> psi)	Initializes a NameSampleSequenceStream with given psi samples.
NameSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<NameSample> psi, NameContextGenerator pcg)	Initializes a NameSampleSequenceStream with given psi samples and an feature generator.
NameSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<NameSample> psi, NameContextGenerator pcg, boolean useOutcomes)	Initializes a NameSampleSequenceStream with given psi samples and an feature generator.
NameSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<NameSample> psi, NameContextGenerator pcg, boolean useOutcomes, SequenceCodec<String> seqCodec)	Initializes a NameSampleSequenceStream with given psi samples and an feature generator.
NameSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<NameSample> psi, AdaptiveFeatureGenerator featureGen)	Initializes a NameSampleSequenceStream with given psi samples and an feature generator.
NameSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<NameSample> psi, AdaptiveFeatureGenerator featureGen, boolean useOutcomes)	Initializes a NameSampleSequenceStream with given psi samples and an feature generator.
[Method Summary]
void close()	Closes the ObjectStream and releases all allocated resources.
Sequence<NameSample> read()	Returns the next ObjectStream object.
void reset()	Repositions the stream at the beginning and the previously seen object sequence will be repeated exactly.
Event[] updateContext(Sequence<NameSample> sequence, AbstractModel model)	Creates a new event array based on the outcomes predicted by the specified parameters for the specified Sequence.
