[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: AdaptiveFeatureGenerator
public class WindowFeatureGenerator extends Object implements AdaptiveFeatureGenerator Generates previous and next features for a given AdaptiveFeatureGenerator.  The window size can be specified.    Features:  Current token is always included unchanged  Previous tokens are prefixed with p distance  Next tokens are prefix with n distance
[Constructor Summary]
WindowFeatureGenerator(int prevWindowSize, int nextWindowSize, AdaptiveFeatureGenerator... generators)	Initializes a WindowFeatureGenerator with the given parameters.
WindowFeatureGenerator(AdaptiveFeatureGenerator generator)	Initializes a WindowFeatureGenerator.
WindowFeatureGenerator(AdaptiveFeatureGenerator... generators)	Initializes a WindowFeatureGenerator.
WindowFeatureGenerator(AdaptiveFeatureGenerator generator, int prevWindowSize, int nextWindowSize)	Initializes a WindowFeatureGenerator with the given parameters.
[Field Summary]
static final String NEXT_PREFIX	
static final String PREV_PREFIX	
[Method Summary]
void clearAdaptiveData()	Informs a feature generator that the context of the adaptive data (typically a document) is no longer valid.
void createFeatures(List<String> features, String[] tokens, int index, String[] preds)	Adds the appropriate features for the token at the specified index with the specified array of previousOutcomes to the specified list of features.
String toString()	
void updateAdaptiveData(String[] tokens, String[] outcomes)	Informs a feature generator that the specified tokens have been classified with the corresponding set of specified outcomes.
