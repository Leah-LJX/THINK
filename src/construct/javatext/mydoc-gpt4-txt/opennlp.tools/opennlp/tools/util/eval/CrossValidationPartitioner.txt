[API Name] opennlp.tools.util.eval.CrossValidationPartitioner<E>
[Type] Class
[Info]
public class CrossValidationPartitioner<E> extends Object Provides access to training and test partitions for n-fold cross validation.    Cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of a classifier when only  training data is available. The training set is split into n parts  and the training / evaluation is performed n times on these parts.  The training partition always consists of n - 1 parts and one part is used for testing.    To use the CrossValidationPartitioner a client iterates over the n  stream. Each CrossValidationPartitioner.TrainingSampleStream represents  one partition and is used first for training and afterwards for testing.  The CrossValidationPartitioner.TestSampleStream can be obtained via the  CrossValidationPartitioner.TrainingSampleStream.getTestSampleStream() method.
