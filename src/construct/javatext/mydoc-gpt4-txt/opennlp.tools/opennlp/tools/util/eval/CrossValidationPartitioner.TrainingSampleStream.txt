Enclosing class: CrossValidationPartitioner<E>
public static class CrossValidationPartitioner.TrainingSampleStream<E> extends Object implements ObjectStream<E> The CrossValidationPartitioner.TrainingSampleStream which iterates over  all training elements.    Note:  After the CrossValidationPartitioner.TestSampleStream was obtained  the CrossValidationPartitioner.TrainingSampleStream must not be used  anymore, otherwise a IllegalStateException  is thrown.    The streams must not be used anymore after the  CrossValidationPartitioner was moved to one of next partitions.  If they are called anyway an IllegalStateException is thrown.
