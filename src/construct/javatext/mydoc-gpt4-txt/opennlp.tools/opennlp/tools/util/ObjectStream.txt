public interface ObjectStream<T> extends AutoCloseable Reads objects from a stream.    Design Decision:  This interface provides a means for iterating over the  objects in a stream, it does not implement Iterator or  Iterable because:   Iterator.next() and Iterator.hasNext() are declared as  throwing no checked exceptions. Thus the IOExceptions thrown by  read() would have to be wrapped in RuntimeExceptions,  and the compiler would be unable to force users of this code to catch  such exceptions. Implementing Iterable would mean either silently calling  reset() to guarantee that all items were always seen on each  iteration, or documenting that the Iterable only iterates over the remaining  elements of the ObjectStream. In either case, users not reading the  documentation carefully might run into unexpected behavior.

ObjectStreamException
[Method Summary]
default void close()	Closes the ObjectStream and releases all allocated resources.
T read()	Returns the next ObjectStream object.
default void reset()	Repositions the stream at the beginning and the previously seen object sequence will be repeated exactly.
