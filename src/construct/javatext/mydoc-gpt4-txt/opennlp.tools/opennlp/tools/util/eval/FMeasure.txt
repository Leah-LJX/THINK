[API Name] opennlp.tools.util.eval.FMeasure
[Type] Class
[Info]
public final class FMeasure extends Object The FMeasure is a utility class for evaluators  which measures precision, recall and the resulting f-measure.    Evaluation results are the arithmetic mean of the precision  scores calculated for each reference sample and  the arithmetic mean of the recall scores calculated for  each reference sample.
