LemmaSampleSequenceStream(ObjectStream<LemmaSample> samples, LemmatizerContextGenerator contextGenerator)	
[Method Summary]
void close()	Closes the ObjectStream and releases all allocated resources.
Sequence<LemmaSample> read()	Returns the next ObjectStream object.
void reset()	Repositions the stream at the beginning and the previously seen object sequence will be repeated exactly.
Event[] updateContext(Sequence<LemmaSample> sequence, AbstractModel model)	Creates a new event array based on the outcomes predicted by the specified parameters for the specified Sequence.
