[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: AutoCloseable, ObjectStream<TokenSample>
public class TokenSampleStream extends FilterObjectStream<String,TokenSample> This class is a stream filter which reads in string encoded  samples and creates samples out of them.  The input string sample is tokenized if a whitespace or the special separator chars occur.    Sample:  "token1 token2 token3<SPLIT>token4"  The tokens token1 and token2 are separated by a whitespace,  token3 and token4 are separated by the special character sequence.  In this case, the default split sequence applies.    Note: The sequence must be unique in the input string and is not escaped.
