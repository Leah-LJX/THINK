[API Name] opennlp.tools.parser.treeinsert.Parser
[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: Parser
public class Parser extends AbstractBottomUpParser A built-attach Parser implementation.    Nodes are built when their left-most child is encountered.  Subsequent children are attached as daughters.  Attachment is based on node in the right-frontier  of the tree. After each attachment or building, nodes are  assessed as either complete or incomplete. Complete nodes  are no longer eligible for daughter attachment.    Complex modifiers which produce additional node  levels of the same type are attached with sister-adjunction.  Attachment can not take place higher in the right-frontier  than an incomplete node.
