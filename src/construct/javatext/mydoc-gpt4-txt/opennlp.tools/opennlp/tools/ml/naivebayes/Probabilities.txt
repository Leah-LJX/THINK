void set(T t, double probability)	Assigns a probability to a label t, discarding any previously assigned probability.
void set(T t, Probability<T> probability)	Assigns a probability to a label t, discarding any previously assigned probability.
void setConfidence(double confidence)	Sets the best confidence with which this set of probabilities has been calculated.
void setIfLarger(T t, double probability)	Assigns a probability to a label t, discarding any previously assigned probability, if the new probability is greater than the old one.
void setLog(T t, double probability)	Assigns a log probability to a label t, discarding any previously assigned probability.
