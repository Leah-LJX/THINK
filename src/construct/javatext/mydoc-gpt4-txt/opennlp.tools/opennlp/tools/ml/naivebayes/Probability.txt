[Type] Class
[Info]
Type Parameters: T - The label (category) class.
Direct Known Subclasses: LogProbability
public class Probability<T> extends Object Class implementing the probability for a label.
[Constructor Summary]
Probability(T label)	Instantiates a Probability with a given label.
[Method Summary]
void addIn(double probability)	Compounds the existing probability mass on the label with the new probability passed in to the method.
Double get()	
T getLabel()	
Double getLog()	
boolean isLarger(Probability<T> probability)	Checks if a probability is greater than the old one.
void set(double probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability.
void set(Probability<T> probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability.
void setIfLarger(double probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability, if the new probability is greater than the old one.
void setIfLarger(Probability<T> probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability, if the new probability is greater than the old one.
void setLog(double probability)	Assigns a log probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability.
