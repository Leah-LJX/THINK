[API Name] opennlp.tools.ml.naivebayes.LogProbabilities<T>
[Type] Class
[Info]
Type Parameters: T - the label (category) class
public class LogProbabilities<T> extends Probabilities<T> Class implementing the probability distribution over labels returned by  a classifier as a log of probabilities.    This is necessary because floating point precision in Java does not allow for high-accuracy  representation of very low probabilities such as would occur in a text categorizer.
