[Type] Class
[Info]
Type Parameters: T - The label (category) class.
public class LogProbability<T> extends Probability<T> A class implementing the logarithmic Probability for a label.
[Constructor Summary]
LogProbability(T label)	
[Method Summary]
void addIn(double probability)	Compounds the existing probability mass on the label with the new probability passed in to the method.
Double get()	
T getLabel()	
Double getLog()	
boolean isLarger(Probability<T> probability)	Checks if a probability is greater than the old one.
void set(double probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability.
void set(Probability<T> probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability.
void setIfLarger(double probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability, if the new probability is greater than the old one.
void setIfLarger(Probability<T> probability)	Assigns a probability to a label, discarding any previously assigned probability, if the new probability is greater than the old one.
