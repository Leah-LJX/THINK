[API Name] opennlp.tools.ml.model.TwoPassDataIndexer
[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: DataIndexer
public class TwoPassDataIndexer extends AbstractDataIndexer Collecting event and context counts by making two passes over the events.    The first pass determines which contexts will be used by the model, and the  second pass creates the events in memory containing only the contexts which  will be used. This greatly reduces the amount of memory required for storing  the events. During the first pass a temporary event file is created which  is read during the second pass.
