[API Name] opennlp.tools.ml.perceptron.SimplePerceptronSequenceTrainer
[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: Trainer, EventModelSequenceTrainer<Event>
public class SimplePerceptronSequenceTrainer extends AbstractEventModelSequenceTrainer Trains models with sequences using the perceptron algorithm.    Each outcome is represented as a binary perceptron classifier.  This supports standard (integer) weighting as well average weighting.    Sequence information is used in a simplified was to that described in:  Discriminative Training Methods for Hidden Markov Models: Theory and Experiments  with the Perceptron Algorithm. Michael Collins, EMNLP 2002.    Specifically only updates are applied to tokens which were incorrectly tagged by a sequence tagger  rather than to all feature across the sequence which differ from the training sequence.
