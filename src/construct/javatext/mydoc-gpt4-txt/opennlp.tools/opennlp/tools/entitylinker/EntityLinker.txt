Type Parameters: T - A type that extends Span. LinkedSpan and BaseLink             are available to provide this signature. Use:             EntityLinker<LinkedSpan<BaseLink>> as a default.
public interface EntityLinker<T extends Span> EntityLinkers establish connections with external data to enrich extracted  entities.    For instance, for Location entities a linker can be developed to  look up each found location in a geonames gazetteer. Another example may be to  find peoples' names and look them up in a database or active directory.  Intended to return n best matches for any given search, but can also be  implemented as deterministic.
