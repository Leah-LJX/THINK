public class PorterStemmer extends Object implements Stemmer A Stemmer, implementing the   Porter Stemming Algorithm

[Method Summary]
void add(char ch)	Add a character to the word being stemmed.
char[] getResultBuffer()	Returns a reference to a character buffer containing the results of the stemming process.
int getResultLength()	Returns the length of the word resulting from the stemming process.
void reset()	reset() resets the stemmer so it can stem another word.
boolean stem()	Stem the word placed into the Stemmer buffer through calls to add().
boolean stem(char[] word)	Stem a word contained in a char[].
boolean stem(char[] word, int wordLen)	Stem a word contained in a leading portion of a char[] array.
boolean stem(char[] wordBuffer, int offset, int wordLen)	Stem a word contained in a portion of a char[] array.
boolean stem(int i0)	
CharSequence stem(CharSequence word)	Stem a word provided as a CharSequence.
String stem(String s)	Stem a word provided as a String.
String toString()	After a word has been stemmed, it can be retrieved by toString(), or a reference to the internal buffer can be retrieved by getResultBuffer and getResultLength (which is generally more efficient.)
