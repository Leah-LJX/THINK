All Implemented Interfaces: AutoCloseable, ObjectStream<NameSample>
@Internal public class EvalitaNameSampleStream extends Object implements ObjectStream<NameSample> Parser for the Italian NER training files of the Evalita 2007 and 2009 NER  shared tasks.    The data does not contain article boundaries,  adaptive data will be cleared for every sentence.    Named Entities are annotated in the IOB2 format (as used in CoNLL 2002 shared task)    The Named Entity tag consists of two parts:  1. The  IOB2 tag: 'B'  (for 'begin')  denotes the  first token  of a     Named Entity,  I (for 'inside')  is used for  all other tokens  in a     Named Entity, and 'O' (for 'outside') is used for all other words;  2. The Entity  type tag: PER  (for Person), ORG  (for Organization),     GPE (for Geo-Political Entity), or LOC (for Location).    Each file  consists of four  columns separated by a  blank, containing  respectively the token, the Elsnet PoS-tag, the Adige news story to  which the token belongs, and the Named Entity tag.    Data can be found on this  web site.   Note:  Do not use this class, internal use only!
