[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: AutoCloseable, ObjectStream<NameSample>
@Internal public class BioNLP2004NameSampleStream extends Object implements ObjectStream<NameSample> A sample stream for the training files of the  BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 shared task.    The data contains five named entity types:   DNA RNA protein cell_type cell_line
 Data can be found on this  website,  or in  this repository.    The BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 data were originally published here:  
   http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/ERtask/report.html,    yet this page was gone when last checked in December 2022.    It looks like this repo contains a copy of the data located on the original page:   The BioNLP 2004 seems to be related to http://www.geniaproject.org/shared-tasks/bionlp-jnlpba-shared-task-2004   Note:  Do not use this class, internal use only!
