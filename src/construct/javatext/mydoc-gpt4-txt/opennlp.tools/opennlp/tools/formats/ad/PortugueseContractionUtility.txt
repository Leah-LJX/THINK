[Type] Class
[Info]
@Internal public class PortugueseContractionUtility extends Object Utility class to handle Portuguese contractions.    Some Corpora split contractions in its parts, for example, "da" > "de" +  "a", but according to the phase of language processing, NER for instance, we  can't decide if to split a contraction or not, specially because contractions  inside names are not separated, but outside are.
  Note:  Do not use this class, internal use only!
