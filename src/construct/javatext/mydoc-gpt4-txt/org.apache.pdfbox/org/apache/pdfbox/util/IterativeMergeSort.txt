[Type] Class
[Info]
public final class IterativeMergeSort extends Object This class provides an iterative (bottom-up) implementation of the  MergeSort algorithm for any generic Java  object which implements a Comparator.
   This implementation uses an iterative implementation approach over the more classical recursive  approach in order to save the auxiliary space required by the call stack in recursive  implementations.  
 Complexity:   Worst case time: O(n log n) Best case time: O(n log n) Average case time: O(n log n) Space: O(n log n)
