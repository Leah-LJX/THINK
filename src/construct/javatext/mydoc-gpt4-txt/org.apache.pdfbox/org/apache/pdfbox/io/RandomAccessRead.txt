[Type] Interface
[Info]
All Superinterfaces: AutoCloseable, Closeable
All Known Subinterfaces: RandomAccess
All Known Implementing Classes: RandomAccessReadBuffer, RandomAccessReadBufferedFile, RandomAccessReadMemoryMappedFile, RandomAccessReadView, RandomAccessReadWriteBuffer, SequenceRandomAccessRead
public interface RandomAccessRead extends Closeable An interface allowing random access read operations.
[Method Summary]
default int available()	Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read.
RandomAccessReadView createView(long startPosition, long streamLength)	Creates a random access read view starting at the given position with the given length.
long getPosition()	Returns offset of next byte to be returned by a read method.
boolean isClosed()	Returns true if this source has been closed.
boolean isEOF()	A simple test to see if we are at the end of the data.
long length()	The total number of bytes that are available.
default int peek()	This will peek at the next byte.
int read()	Read a single byte of data.
default int read(byte[] b)	Read a buffer of data.
int read(byte[] b, int offset, int length)	Read a buffer of data.
default void rewind(int bytes)	Seek backwards the given number of bytes.
void seek(long position)	Seek to a position in the data.
default void skip(int length)	Skips a given number of bytes.
