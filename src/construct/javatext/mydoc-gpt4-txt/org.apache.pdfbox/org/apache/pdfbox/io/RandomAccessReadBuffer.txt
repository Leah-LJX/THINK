[API Name] org.apache.pdfbox.io.RandomAccessReadBuffer
[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: Closeable, AutoCloseable, RandomAccessRead
Direct Known Subclasses: RandomAccessReadWriteBuffer
public class RandomAccessReadBuffer extends Object implements RandomAccessRead An implementation of the RandomAccessRead interface to store data in memory. The data will be stored in chunks  organized in an ArrayList.
[Constructor Summary]
protected RandomAccessReadBuffer()	Default constructor.
RandomAccessReadBuffer(byte[] input)	Create a random access buffer using the given byte array.
RandomAccessReadBuffer(ByteBuffer input)	Create a random access buffer using the given ByteBuffer.
RandomAccessReadBuffer(InputStream input)	Create a random access read buffer of the given input stream by copying the data to the memory.
protected RandomAccessReadBuffer(int definedChunkSize)	Default constructor.
[Field Summary]
protected int chunkSize	
protected ByteBuffer currentBuffer	
protected int currentBufferPointer	
static int DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE_4KB	
protected long pointer	
protected long size	
[Method Summary]
protected void checkClosed()	Ensure that the RandomAccessBuffer is not closed
void close()	
static RandomAccessReadBuffer createBufferFromStream(InputStream inputStream)	Create e new RandomAccessReadBuffer using the given InputStream.
RandomAccessReadView createView(long startPosition, long streamLength)	Creates a random access read view starting at the given position with the given length.
protected void expandBuffer()	create a new buffer chunk and adjust all pointers and indices.
long getPosition()	Returns offset of next byte to be returned by a read method.
boolean isClosed()	Returns true if this source has been closed.
boolean isEOF()	A simple test to see if we are at the end of the data.
long length()	The total number of bytes that are available.
int read()	Read a single byte of data.
int read(byte[] b, int offset, int length)	Read a buffer of data.
protected void resetBuffers()	Reset to position 0 and remove all buffers but the first one.
void seek(long position)	Seek to a position in the data.
