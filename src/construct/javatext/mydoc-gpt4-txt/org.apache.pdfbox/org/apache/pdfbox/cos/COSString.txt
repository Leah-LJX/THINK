[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: COSObjectable
public final class COSString extends COSBase A string object, which may be a text string, a PDFDocEncoded string, ASCII string, or byte string.
 Text strings are used for character strings that contain information intended to be  human-readable, such as text annotations, bookmark names, article names, document information,  and so forth.
 PDFDocEncoded strings are used for characters that are represented in a single byte.
 ASCII strings are used for characters that are represented in a single byte using ASCII  encoding.
 Byte strings are used for binary data represented as a series of bytes, but the encoding is  not known. The bytes of the string need not represent characters.
