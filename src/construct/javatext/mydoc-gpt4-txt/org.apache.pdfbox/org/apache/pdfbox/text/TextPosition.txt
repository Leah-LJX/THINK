[Method Summary]
boolean contains(TextPosition tp2)	Determine if this TextPosition logically contains another (i.e.
boolean equals(Object o)	
int[] getCharacterCodes()	Return the internal PDF character codes of the glyphs in this text.
float getDir()	Return the direction/orientation of the string in this object based on its text matrix.
float getEndX()	This will get the x coordinate of the end position.
float getEndY()	This will get the y coordinate of the end position.
PDFont getFont()	This will get the font for the text being drawn.
float getFontSize()	This will get the font size that has been set with the "Tf" operator (Set text font and size).
float getFontSizeInPt()	This will get the font size in pt.
float getHeight()	This will get the maximum height of all characters in this string.
float getHeightDir()	This will get the maximum height of all characters in this string.
float[] getIndividualWidths()	Get the widths of each individual character.
float getPageHeight()	This will get the height of the page that the text is located in.
float getPageWidth()	This will get the width of the page that the text is located in.
int getRotation()	This will get the rotation of the page that the text is located in.
Matrix getTextMatrix()	The matrix containing the starting text position and scaling.
String getUnicode()	Return the string of characters stored in this object.
String getVisuallyOrderedUnicode()	Same as getUnicode() except that returned text is ensured to be visually ordered (i.e.
float getWidth()	This will get the width of the string when page rotation adjusted coordinates are used.
float getWidthDirAdj()	This will get the width of the string when text direction adjusted coordinates are used.
float getWidthOfSpace()	This will get the width of a space character.
float getX()	This will get the page rotation adjusted x position of the character.
float getXDirAdj()	This will get the text direction adjusted x position of the character.
float getXScale()	This will get the X scaling factor.
float getY()	This will get the page rotation adjusted x position of the character.
float getYDirAdj()	This will get the y position of the text, adjusted so that 0,0 is upper left and it is adjusted based on the text direction.
float getYScale()	This will get the Y scaling factor.
int hashCode()	
boolean isDiacritic()	
void mergeDiacritic(TextPosition diacritic)	Merge a single character TextPosition into the current object.
String toString()	Show the string data for this text position.
