[Type] Class
[Info]
public class JpegIptcRewriter extends JpegRewriter Interface for Exif write/update/remove functionality for Jpeg/JFIF images.
[Constructor Summary]
JpegIptcRewriter()	
[Method Summary]
void removeIPTC​(byte[] src, OutputStream os)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(byte[] src, OutputStream os, boolean removeSegment)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged (unless removeSegment is true) and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(File src, OutputStream os)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(File src, OutputStream os, boolean removeSegment)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged (unless removeSegment is true) and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(InputStream src, OutputStream os)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(InputStream src, OutputStream os, boolean removeSegment)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged (unless removeSegment is true) and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(ByteSource byteSource, OutputStream os)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged and writes the result to a stream.
void removeIPTC​(ByteSource byteSource, OutputStream os, boolean removeSegment)	Reads a Jpeg image, removes all IPTC data from the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged (unless removeSegment is true) and writes the result to a stream.
void writeIPTC​(byte[] src, OutputStream os, PhotoshopApp13Data newData)	Reads a Jpeg image, replaces the IPTC data in the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged and writes the result to a stream.
void writeIPTC​(File src, OutputStream os, PhotoshopApp13Data newData)	Reads a Jpeg image, replaces the IPTC data in the App13 segment but leaves the other data in that segment (if present) unchanged and writes the result to a stream.
