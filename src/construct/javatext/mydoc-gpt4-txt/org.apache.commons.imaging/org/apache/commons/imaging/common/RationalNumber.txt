[Type] Class
[Info]
All Implemented Interfaces: Serializable
public class RationalNumber extends Number Rational number, as used by the TIFF image format.    The TIFF format specifies two data types for rational numbers based on  a pair of 32-bit integers.  Rational is based on unsigned 32-bit integers  and SRational is based on signed 32-bit integers.  This treatment is  problematic in Java because Java does not support unsigned types.  To address this challenge, this class stores the numerator and divisor  in long (64-bit) integers, applying masks as necessary for the unsigned  type.
